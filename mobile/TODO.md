- [x] ** Add ability to swipe and change months for mobile app **:

  - Add ability to swipe & change months for mobile app instead of needing to press on arrow icons.

- [x] ** Add ability to sort filtered transactions for mobile app **:

  - Add ability to sort filtered transactions to show highest amount spent for that month, etc.

- [ ] ** Fix misleading error msg upon pull to refresh **:

  - Fix the green pop up message that appears upon pull to refresh when new transactions are added but error msg states that no new transactions were found which is a false positive. Error message should only appear when no new transactions are genuinely added (should appear in red), anmd a green info message will show when new transactions are added - possibily when the number of new transactions added.
