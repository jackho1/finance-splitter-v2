
## Suggested Optimizations

1. **Refactor Totals Calculation Logic**:
   - Extract the totals calculation logic into a separate function to improve readability and maintainability.

2. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Enhance error handling in the `handleUpdate` function to provide more user-friendly messages and possibly implement retry logic for failed updates.

3. **Optimize API Calls**:
   - Implement caching for API responses to reduce the number of requests made to the backend, especially for labels and transactions that do not change frequently.

4. **Add Loading Indicators**:
   - Introduce loading indicators while fetching data from the backend to enhance user experience during data loading.

5. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Remove any unused imports and variables to keep the codebase clean and efficient.

6. **Unit Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for critical functions, especially for the totals calculation and filtering logic, to ensure reliability and facilitate future changes.

7. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Review the UI components for accessibility compliance, ensuring that all interactive elements are keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly.

8. **Styling Consistency**:
   - Ensure consistent styling across all components, possibly by using a CSS-in-JS solution or a CSS framework.

9. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Analyze the performance of the application and identify any bottlenecks, especially in rendering large lists of transactions.

10. **Documentation**:
    - Update the documentation to reflect any new features or changes made to the application.
